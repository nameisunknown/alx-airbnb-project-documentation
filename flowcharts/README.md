Objective: Map the workflow and processes of the backend features.

Instructions:

Choose one of the key backend processes (e.g., user registration, property booking) and design a flowchart in Draw.io to visualize the steps and data flow for this process.

Export the flowchart as a PNG and store it in the flowcharts directory under the alx-airbnb-project-documentation GitHub repository.
